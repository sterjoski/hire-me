## How to get started

-   Fork this repository
-   Create a small application in React (or another agreed upon framework)
-   Describe your design decisions and setup instructions in the README.md of the forked repository

## The assignment

You are tasked to build a simple application for a nursery to manage the attendance of children each day.

The application should be able to do 3 things:

1. List children with some form of pagination/lazy-loading/infinite-scroll
2. Checkin a child
3. Checkout a child

Don't worry about design or anything like that.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to the person who sent you the assignment ‚ò∫Ô∏è
